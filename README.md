## Understanding
A computational technique used to examine the behaviour of molecules over time is called molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. It is used to simulate how atoms and molecules move and interact. It is based on the principles of statistical thermodynamics and classical mechanics. Researchers can study how complex biomolecules like proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids function in their natural environments by using MD simulations to obtain detailed information about the structure and dynamics of these molecules.The development of new drugs is one of the main uses for MD simulations. Researchers may be able to save time and money by predicting a drug's effectiveness before it is tested in a lab by simulating the interactions between potential drug candidates and their target biomolecules. In order to understand how materials behave at the atomic level, which is crucial for creating new materials with particular properties, MD simulations are also used in materials science and nanoscience.MD simulations are used to study chemical reactions and reaction mechanisms in the field of chemistry, revealing information about how reactions happen and how they can be optimised. MD simulations in protein chemistry can assist researchers in comprehending protein folding and stability as well as interactions between proteins and other biomolecules.

In a variety of fields, MD simulations are an effective tool for studying how molecules behave because they give detailed insights into molecular dynamics that are challenging to obtain using only experimental techniques.
